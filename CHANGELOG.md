## [Unreleased]

...

## [3.2.0] - 2023-08-19

### Added

- Functionality to deduplicate in-flight function invocations

### Change

- This should be considered an implementation detail but as part of the deduplication functionality, there has been a subtle change to the library where it will wait for the cache persistence before returning the result. Theoretically, it means an uncached request will be slower for the time it takes to write to your cache. It's a trade-off.

## [3.1.3] - 2023-06-19

### Fixed

- Exported missing `EmitterEvents` constant

## [3.1.2] - 2023-06-11

### Fixed

- Transpiled away any uses of the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) since Webpack 4 doesn't support it

## [3.1.1] - 2023-05-10

### Fixed

- Update main cache value type to reflect that the awaited value is stored

## [3.1.0] - 2023-02-14

### Added

- Expose a `.delete()` convenience method to manually remove cache entries

## [3.0.0] - 2023-02-09

### Changed

- Return type from `swr` cache function now returns a payload object containing the cache value and not just the cache value.
- Event emitter events that used `cachedTime` changed to `cachedAt`
- `swr.persist()` function now throws if an error occurs while writing to storage
